# Easymount

easymount is a convenience script for easily mounting and unmounting, e.g., USB drives.

It lists mounted/mountable drives with `dmenu`, mounts/unmounts them with `udisksctl`, and sends a success/error message with `notify-send`. Thus it requires those programs. But, of course, you're free to tailor to taste.
